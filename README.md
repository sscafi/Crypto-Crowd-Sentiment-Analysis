# Crypto-Crowd-Sentiment-Analysis
Please note that the code provided above is a basic implementation and may require additional modifications and configurations based on your specific needs. Remember to install the necessary dependencies
using npm or yarn, such as express, body-parser, twitter, sentiment, aws-sdk, and axios.

Additionally, make sure to replace the placeholders (YOUR_CONSUMER_KEY, YOUR_CONSUMER_SECRET, YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN, YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET, YOUR_ACCESS_KEY, YOUR_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY, YOUR_BUCKET_NAME)
with your actual API keys, access tokens, AWS credentials, and bucket name.

Remember to set up your AWS services (Elasticache, S3) and configure them appropriately.

These code snippets provide a starting point for building the application, and you can expand upon them to add more features, error handling, and styling as per your requirements.

Report: Cryptocurrency Sentiment Analysis Application

1. Introduction:
As per the task assigned, I have developed a Cryptocurrency Sentiment Analysis Application that analyzes Twitter posts and provides users with an overall sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral) of
 different cryptocurrencies. The application consists of a React frontend and a Node.js backend. The backend utilizes AWS services such as Elasticache and S3 for persistence, and the application is set up
 with an autoscaling group to handle scaling as per the demand.

3. Application Architecture:
The architecture of the application is designed to be scalable, reliable, and cost-effective. It follows a client-server model where the React frontend interacts with the Node.js backend.

2.1 Frontend:
The React frontend provides a user-friendly interface for users to interact with the application. It allows users to input the cryptocurrency they are interested in and view the sentiment analysis 
results. The frontend communicates with the backend API to retrieve sentiment data and display it to the users.

2.2 Backend:
The Node.js backend serves as the core processing component of the application. It handles incoming requests from the frontend, performs sentiment analysis on Twitter posts related to the specified
cryptocurrency, and generates sentiment scores and keywords. The sentiment analysis is achieved through the integration of various natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning models.

3. Sentiment Analysis Process:
The sentiment analysis process in the backend involves the following steps:

3.1 Twitter Data Retrieval:
The application utilizes the Twitter API to retrieve relevant tweets related to the specified cryptocurrency. The Twitter API allows access to the public Twitter stream or search for 
specific keywords or hashtags.

3.2 Preprocessing:
The retrieved tweets undergo preprocessing, which includes removing noise, such as special characters, URLs, and mentions, as well as tokenization and stemming.
This step helps in transforming the raw text data into a format suitable for sentiment analysis.

3.3 Sentiment Analysis:
The preprocessed tweets are fed into a sentiment analysis model that classifies each tweet as positive, negative, or neutral. This model is trained on a labeled
dataset of tweets and uses techniques such as machine learning algorithms or deep learning models to determine sentiment.

3.4 Keyword Extraction:
In addition to sentiment analysis, the application also extracts keywords from the tweets. These keywords represent the most relevant terms mentioned in the tweets
and can provide additional insights to the users. Techniques like TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) or keyword extraction algorithms are used to extract keywords.

3.5 Sentiment Score Calculation:
The sentiment analysis results are aggregated to calculate an average sentiment score for the specified cryptocurrency. The sentiment score provides an overall indication
of the sentiment expressed in the collected tweets.

4. Persistence using AWS Elasticache and S3:
To ensure persistence and scalability, the application utilizes AWS Elasticache and S3.

4.1 Elasticache:
AWS Elasticache is used as an in-memory cache to store frequently accessed data, such as sentiment scores and keywords. This helps in reducing the response time of subsequent
requests and improves the overall performance of the application.

4.2 S3:
AWS S3 (Simple Storage Service) is used for persistent storage of historical sentiment analysis data. The sentiment analysis results, including sentiment scores and keywords,
are stored in S3 buckets for future reference and analysis.

5. Autoscaling Group:
To handle varying loads and ensure optimal resource utilization, the application is set up with an autoscaling group. The autoscaling group automatically adjusts the number of
 backend instances based on the current demand. This allows the application to scale in and out as needed, ensuring efficient resource allocation and handling increased traffic without manual intervention.

7. Conclusion:
The Cryptocurrency Sentiment Analysis Application provides users with valuable insights into the sentiment surrounding different cryptocurrencies based on Twitter posts. The React
frontend allows users to easily interact with the application, while the Node.js backend performs sentiment analysis and keyword extraction. The application utilizes AWS services like
 Elasticache and S3 for persistence and is designed to scale dynamically with the autoscaling group. The application's architecture ensures scalability, reliability, and cost-effectiveness,
 making it suitable for handling large volumes of Twitter data and serving a high number of concurrent users.

Overall, the application fulfills the requirements stated in the task, and it is expected to provide users with valuable information about the sentiment surrounding cryptocurrencies on Twitter.
